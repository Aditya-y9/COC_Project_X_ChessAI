### GIT & GITHUB :

GIT is a version control system that helps to keep track of the changes in our code (eg : file insertion, deletion of file, changes in lines of code), which runs like a software on our computer.
GITHUB is a website which allows developers to store and manage their codes using the tool called GIT. Folders on github are referred as repository.

### GITHUB COMMANDS :
- *git clone <-link->* : cloning a repository on our local machine 
- *git status* : displays the status of code (staged, untracked, modified, unmodified)
- *git add <-filename->* : adds the new or changed file in the working directory to the git staging area
- *git add .* : adds multiple files
- *git commit -m "some msg"* : records the changes made finally
- *git push origin main* : uploads the local repo content to the remote repo
- *git init* : initializes a new git repository
- *git remote add origin <-link->* : set the remote repo to the origin
- *git remote -v* : to verify remote
- *git branch* : to check the branch
- *git branch -M main* : to rename a branch
- *git checkout <-branch_name->* : navigates from current branch to designated branch
- *git checkout -b <-new_branch_name->* : creates a new branch
- *git branch -d <-branch_name->* : deletes a branch
- *git diff <-branch_name->* : compares the current and specified branches
- *git merge <-branch-name->* : merges the current branch into specified one
- *git pull origin main* : updates the changes made in remote repo into local repo
- *git reset <-filename->* : undo the staged changes of a file
- *git reset* : undo the staged changes of a multiple files
- *git reset HEAD~1* :  undo the last commited change
- *git reset <-commit_hash>* : undo the changes done multiple commits back
- *git log* : view the commits along with their hashes
